# 🦀 30 Days of Learning Rust
	
Welcome to my **30-Day Rust Challenge**! 🚀  
Over the next month, I'll be diving into the Rust programming language, sharing daily progress, notes, code snippets, and reflections. Follow along if you're curious about systems programming, memory safety, or just want to learn something new with me! 🙌

---

## 🔥 Why Rust?

- 💾 Memory safety without garbage collection  
- ⚡ High performance like C/C++  
- 🛠️ Great tooling (Cargo, Clippy, etc.)  
- 🧠 Strong typing and expressive syntax  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Friendly and helpful community  

---

## 📅 Challenge Structure

Each day includes:
- 📚 What I learned  
- 🧪 A small project or snippet  
- 📝 Reflections or key takeaways
